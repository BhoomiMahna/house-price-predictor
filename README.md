# House Price Predictor 🏠

This is a simple linear regression project where we predict house prices based on area using Python and scikit-learn.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Project Description
We trained a linear regression model using data like:

| Area (sq ft) | Price (₹) |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1000         | 150000    |
| 1500         | 200000    |
| 2000         | 250000    |

Then, we predicted price for new values like 3300 sq ft.
